- Is it too soon to start implementing?
- What are the pros and cons of the multiple options?
- Are you placing too much importance on abstract design shit?
- Will people read what you wrote?  Should you walk someone through the problem?
- Do you have concrete inputs and outputs to clarify the needs?
- Can you do this in iterations?  Do, defer, deny?  Some but not all yet?
- Zero, one, infinity OR 0, 1/2, 1
- Elegant?
- Is the solution generalizing an edge case?
- Do you have global and local perspectives?
- Have you considered time and space requirements? 
- Have you considered direct and indirect effects?
- Is there a choice that is extremely simple compared to the others?  In other words, don't over engineer.
- What eases future changes, enhancements, or additions of functionality?
- What is your preferred choice and forced choice?  How can you loosen constraints to allow the preferred choice to be the choice?

If you can't decide on a good solution, come back to it later.

Benefits of long-term solutions:
- Don't have to do things multiple times (one short, one long)
- Can build upcoming things on top of long-term solutions (short solving specific problems only)
